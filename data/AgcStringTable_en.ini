# Welcome! This file contains text AndroidGameController
# uses in its UI and other places!
#
# PLEASE NOTE that I use a set of conventions for writing this file
# that perhaps you too should use, for the sake of my sanity! :sweat_smile:
#
# ...here it is!:
# <-- Use the `#` hash symbol for comments that are... actual comments. Leave a space after it.
# Use the `;` symbol for comments with data. DON'T leave a space after it.
#
# Section names should be written in `PascalCase`, and property names use `camelCase`:
# ```ini
# [SectionName]
# propertyName=value
# ```
#
# Also, don't use comments after values - that is, this won't work!:
# ```ini
# propertyName=value # Comment
# ```
#

[Meta] # Stuff that doesn't fit in some other category. "Miscellaneous".
